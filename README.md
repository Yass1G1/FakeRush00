# Fake Rush 01 -- By Yanal and Yassine
Here is the rush project that we had to do in the 42 C Piscine

## Quick Explanation of how to use it : 
- Navigate into the `sources/` directory
- Open the main.c
- Change the **x** and **y** values regarding how you want the rectangle to be
- Don't forget to save
- compile it with this command : `cc ft_putchar.c main.c rush00.c -W -W -W`
- run the program with this command : `./a.out`
- Here it is : you got _rectangle'd_
